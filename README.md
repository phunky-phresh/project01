# Project 01 - Board Files

For Project 01 my goal was to create a Snowboard review app. It would also include educational content to give better understanding of the technology involved with snowboard design, technology that can have significant influence over a snowboards compatibility with a rider based off their experience, where they're using it and how they're using it.

##Core Requirements for Project01

- Models. Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are associated correctly!
- Views. Use partials to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
- Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
- Use Gems Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app.
- User Login. Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up (if you need it).
- Heroku. Deploy your code to Heroku.

##Add ons

- bootstrap: I used bootstrap for styling. this was especially useful for the forms and index pages for quick media responsive layouts.
- introJs: introJs is a quick and easy tutorial app. I used this to explain the functionality of certain features in the web app, such as the search function and form inputs
- pg_search: The pg_search gem is how my search function works in the main Snowboard index. It can search by table information in the produc table, or in its associated tables eg. profiles
