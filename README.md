# Project 01 - Board Files

For Project 01 my goal was to create a Snowboard review app. It would also include educational content to give better understanding of the technology involved with snowboard design, technology that can have significant influence over a snowboards compatibility with a rider based off their experience, where they're using it and how they're using it.
